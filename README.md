# nsenter in a can

This is a small Docker recipe to build `nsenter` easily and install it in your
system.


## What is `nsenter`?

It is a small tool allowing to `enter` into `n`ame`s`paces. Technically,
it can enter existing namespaces, or spawn a process into a new set of
namespaces. "What are those namespaces you're blabbering about?"
We are talking about [container namespaces].

`nsenter` can do many useful things, but the main reason why I'm so
excited about it is because it lets you [enter into a Docker container].


## Why build `nsenter` in a container?

This is because my preferred distros (Debian and Ubuntu) ship with an
outdated version of `util-linux` (the package that should contain `nsenter`).
Therefore, if you need `nsenter` on those distros, you have to juggle with
APT repository, or compile from source, orâ€¦ Nobody ain't got time for that.

I'm going to make a very bold assumption: if you landed here, it's because
you want to enter a Docker container. Therefore, you won't mind if my
method to build `nsenter` uses Docker itself.


## How do I install `nsenter` with this?

If you want to install `nsenter` into `/usr/local/bin`, just do this:

    docker run -v /usr/local/bin:/target jpetazzo/nsenter

The `jpetazzo/nsenter` container will detect that `/target` is a
mountpoint, and it will copy the `nsenter` binary into it.

If you don't trust me, and prefer to extract the `nsenter` binary,
rather than allowing my container to potentially wreak havoc into
your system's `$PATH`, you can also do this:

    docker run jpetazzo/nsenter cat /nsenter > /tmp/nsenter

Then do whatever you want with the binary in `/tmp/nsenter`.


##  How do I *use* `nsenter`?

First, figure out the PID of the container you want to enter:

    PID=$(docker inspect --format {{.State.Pid}} <container_name_or_ID>)

Then enter the container:

    nsenter --target $PID --mount --uts --ipc --net --pid

Combining those two steps into a single command is left as an exercise for
the reader.

If you are using boot2docker, you could check this blog post about
[Debugging a Docker container] by [Nicolas De Loof], showing how
to use `nsenter` with boot2docker.


## Caveats

- This only works on Intel 64 bits platforms. Arguably, this is the
  only officially supported platform for Docker; so it's not a big deal.
  As soon as the Docker registry supports other architectures, I will
  see how to build `nsenter` for those!
- `nsenter` still needs to run from the host; it cannot run inside a
  container (yet).
